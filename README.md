# city-svg

A (very early draft of a) framework for displaying St. Louis City data by on a precinct/ward level.

## SVG files
The SVG data currently only contains St. Louis City, but if you're interested, it's possible to create your own svg files by exporting a shapefile from your county/municipality, importing into QGIS and then exporting as a SVG. There is probably a better way to extract it (I did it by hand), but it would be possible to create similar "ward-precinct objects" if someone knows it.
